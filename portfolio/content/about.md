I'm a sophomore studying computer science at UPenn.

I'm really interested in machine learning and AI, and I am eager to explore as much as I can.

On campus, I'm involved with several different types of organizations.

* I'm the bassist for the Mask and Wig band
* I am an associate consultant for Engineering Consultants at Penn
* I help to organize the Ivy League Model UN Conference (ILMUNC).
